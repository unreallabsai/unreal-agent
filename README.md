# Unreal Agent

An async-first agent harness from Unreal Labs.

- [harness/](harness/) — the library.
- [cmd/](cmd/) — executables that use the library.
  - [cmd/unreal-agent-runner](cmd/unreal-agent-runner) - cloud agent runner.
  - [cmd/unreal-agent-tui](cmd/unreal-agent-tui) - cozy TUI.
- [benchmarks/](benchmarks/) — benchmark runners.

## Glossary

- **Input**: an event with a caller-supplied globally unique ID that remains
  stable across redeliveries.
- **Inbox**: session-scoped, in-memory deduplication of external, control, and
  crash inputs.
- **Session**: append-only persisted history that can be forked.
- **LLM turn**: the coordinator-managed sequence around one logical LLM request.
- **Tool**: a capability described by a schema and bound to a translator.
- **Tool call**: a model-produced request to use a tool.
- **Tool translator**: validates a tool call and translates it into one or more
  operations. It runs synchronously on the coordinator's event loop and must not
  perform I/O or suspend the loop.
- **Tool call status**: the translation outcome: a validation error or references
  to submitted operations. Operation execution state is tracked separately;
  the translator formats these into a model-facing result.
- **Operation**: a serializable description of work produced by a tool translator
  for asynchronous execution. Implementations are encouraged to use the available
  [primitives](harness/primitives/).

## Components

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Session inbox | Volatile, session-scoped input idempotency. |
| Coordinator | Persist accepted inputs, run LLM turns, resolve tool translators through the registry, and dispatch committed operations. |
| Session store | Persist canonical session history and operation state; support recovery and forks; atomically record tool-call status with operations. |
| Context builder | Statefully assemble model input in memory. Return the model input together with a record of anything omitted, truncated, or compacted. Perform no I/O and accept no persistence dependencies. |
| LLM Adapter | Send prepared model input to a provider and return a normalized completed response. Own authentication, cancellation, and provider errors. |
| Tool registry | Own the fixed Bash, ViewImage, and skill-use definitions and their translators; expose the host-selected set. |
| Tool translator | Validate a tool call and produce its status and operations. Format a recorded call status and prepared operation output into model results. Perform no I/O. |
| Operation manager | Actor runtime for durable operations. The local implementation is swappable. |

## Extending the harness

Harness components are composable, and alternative implementations of their interfaces are encouraged.

We intend to preserve these invariants:

- Session-store items are serializable, and the storage format is versioned.
- We'll do our best to maintain backwards compatibility for sessions.
  An unsupported session version will always cause an explicit error on resume.
- Operations are versioned and always serializable.

For example, a proxy operations manager can send serialized operations to a
local operations manager running in a process inside a remote sandbox, allowing
tools to execute there.
